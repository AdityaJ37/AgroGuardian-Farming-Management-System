AgroGuardian-Farming Management System
This project addresses the critical challenges faced by farmers in selecting the appropriate crops and fertilizers for their land. The system employs advanced machine learning algorithms and IoT technology to provide accurate recommendations, thereby enhancing agricultural productivity.

The core components of the project include:

Crop Recommendation System: Utilizes machine learning models like Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression to analyze environmental parameters and soil characteristics, offering farmers precise crop suggestions.
Fertilizer Recommendation System: Based on Python logic, this system compares optimal nutrient levels with the user's soil data to recommend the appropriate fertilizers.
Real-Time Testing with IoT: Integrates various sensors (NPK, soil moisture, temperature) and an Arduino Nano board to gather real-time soil data, which is then used to test the recommendation system.
The project aims to provide a robust and reliable tool for farmers, helping them make informed decisions, reduce crop selection errors, and ultimately improve their yield and profitability.
